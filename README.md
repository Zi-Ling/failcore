**When your agent breaks, you don't need better prompts — you need a circuit breaker.**

FailCore is a **fail-fast execution runtime** for AI agents.  
It does not try to make agents smarter — it makes them **safe and reliable**.

While frameworks like LangChain focus on *planning*, FailCore focuses on what happens **during execution**:
enforcing permissions, blocking side-effects (network & filesystem), and generating forensic audit logs.

---

## 🧪 Experimental: Proxy Mode (Pre-release)

FailCore is actively developing an **experimental proxy mode**, distributed via GitHub **pre-releases**.

The proxy runs in front of LLM providers and **transparently forwards requests** while observing and tracing execution at runtime. It is streaming-aware and designed as a foundation for future execution-time enforcement and auditing.

> Proxy mode is experimental and not production-ready. APIs and behaviors may change.

---

## 💰 Cost Tracking (Early Stage)

Cost-related features are under early development, focusing on traceability and provider compatibility. Expect changes as APIs evolve.

---

## ▶️ Execution-Time Protection (Live Demo)

FailCore enforces security **at tool invocation time** —  
before any network or filesystem side-effect occurs.

> Demo: Tool-level SSRF protection with strict network policy and full execution trace.

## 📸 See It In Action (Audit Report)

FailCore automatically generates audit HTML reports for every run.

> *This audit report captures a failed execution, providing a structured timeline, incident analysis, and trace-backed evidence for post-incident inspection.*

## ✨ What's New (v0.1.x)

- 🛡️ **SSRF Protection** — Network-layer validation (DNS resolution and private IP checks).
- 📂 **Filesystem Sandbox** — Detects and blocks `../` path traversal attacks.
- 📊 **Audit Reports** — One-command generation of professional HTML dashboards.
- 🎯 **Semantic Status** — Clear distinction between `BLOCKED` (threat neutralized) vs `FAIL` (tool error).

## 🔥 Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install failcore
```

> Note: The PyPI package may lag behind the latest features. For the newest builds (including experimental proxy mode), use GitHub Releases.


### 2. Generate Report

```bash
failcore show
failcore report --last > report.html
```

> *The report provides a human-readable summary of execution results, highlighting blocked operations and failure points.*

## Why FailCore?

Modern AI agents are fragile. FailCore addresses core execution risks:

| Risk | Without FailCore | With FailCore |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| **Security (SSRF)** | Agent can access internal metadata services. | **BLOCKED** by network-layer validation. |
| **Filesystem** | Agent can read/write arbitrary files via `../`. | **BLOCKED** by strict sandbox enforcement. |
| **Cost** | One step fails, entire workflow restarts. | **DETERMINISTIC REPLAY** of successful steps. |
| **Visibility** | Thousands of log lines. | **FORENSIC REPORT** with clear verdicts. |
